highways: mention taillanter preprint 2022 (with barthelemy)

nodes: briefly explain why/how DBscan for node consolidation is used (cf. serra et gil for porto?)

edges: description/terminology: cf. hermosilla 2014 'UBRSA'; see strano 2012 for power law of "land cells" (spaces surrounded by street segments); most recent: shpuza 2011, 2017, 2022 (how to get the PDF...). circular compactness - inspired by louf; see also more recent barthelemy 2017 with the same figures;
