% Outline



% Make a strong case for the fact that our method is very simple (it is not a machine
% learning algorithm); computationally cheap; AND manages to capture BOTH elongated
% bananas and intersection bananas with ONE stroke and ONE index, which is possible thanks
% to the CHARACTERISTIC PATTERNS in urban street networks. As demonstrated in the scatter
% plot \ref{fig:banana-scatter}...

% etc.


% \textit{Sanzana et al. propose an algorithm for identification and elimination of
% ``bad-shaped polygons'', incl. streets/roads/footpaths. Explain that while we have
% a comparable approach, we are concerned with *cities* while they are concerned
% with *hydrological models*; and since cities express some certain regularities
% we can make use of that}

% \subsection*{Method section on finding the minimum and using it as a threshold
% (put part of this in results maybe?)}

%     istribution(s) for FUA X. - show the two-peak pattern]}
%     \label{fig:si-dist}
% \end{figure}

% Many, though not all, shape index frequency distributions for the analyzed FUAs reveal a
% common feature of two prominent peaks (see Figure \ref{fig:si-dist}). Through visual
% analysis, we find that these peaks represent two different types of polygons. Most of
% the polygons from the first (leftmost) peak can be attributed to ``bananas’’ in the
% street network, whereas most of the polygons from the second (rightmost) peak represent
% true urban blocks. Therefore, for FUAs that show a pronounced two-peak pattern in their
% shape index frequency distribution, the minimum \textit{between} the two peaks can be
% used as shape index threshold: polygons with a shape index below the threshold will most
% likely be ``bananas’’; polygons with a shape index above the threshold will most likely
% be true urban blocks. To derive the minimum, we approximate the shape index frequency
% distribution with a Gaussian kernel density estimation. For bandwidth selection, we use
% the parametric Silverman method \cite{silverman_using_1981} and find that it gives
% satisfactory results; non-parametric bandwidth selection methods might be a subject for
% future work (see section \ref{sec:discussion}).

% Many, though not all, shape index frequency distributions for the analyzed FUAs reveal a common feature of two prominent peaks (see Figure \ref{fig:si-dist}). Through visual analysis, we find that these peaks represent two different types of polygons. Most of the polygons from the first (leftmost) peak can be attributed to ``bananas’’ in the street network, whereas most of the polygons from the second (rightmost) peak represent true urban blocks. Therefore, for FUAs that show a pronounced two-peak pattern in their shape index frequency distribution, the minimum \textit{between} the two peaks can be used as shape index threshold: polygons with a shape index below the threshold will most likely be ``bananas’’; polygons with a shape index above the threshold will most likely be true urban blocks.

For bandwidth selection, we use the parametric Silverman method \cite{silverman_using_1981} and find that it gives satisfactory results; non-parametric bandwidth selection methods might be a subject for future work (see section \ref{sec:discussion}).

% Next, comparing the positions of peak 1, peak 2, and shape index threshold for different
% FUAs with pronounced two-peak patterns, we find that maxima positions vary to a
% considerably greater extent than minima positions. In other words, shape index
% thresholds for ``banana’’ identification from morphologically different FUAs lie within
% a relatively narrow range. We therefore hypothesize that applying a shape index
% threshold within the range identified from FUAs whose polygons follow a two-peak
% distribution will allow the identification of ``bananas’’ polygons even for those FUAs
% whose distributions do not show a two-peak pattern. Applying the … [TBD: lower
% boundary/median/average/higher boundary] of the empirically derived shape index
% threshold range to the rest of FUAs indeed reveals ``bananas´´ polygons in all/most FUAs
% (see Figure \ref{fig:city}).
