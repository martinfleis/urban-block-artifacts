\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

- area vs shape plots
    - use all cases together and show multiple shape indices
- Reock as an optimal index (?) [I think it will be the optimal one but we need to verify that]
- 1-dimensional index formula (if we use Reock it is the one from the banana notebook)
- shape-index plots with cut-off values
- plots based on geographical location
    - distributions, Reock-area scatters
    - describe the differences
- formalise the detection workflow
