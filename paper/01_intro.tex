\subsection{why do we care?}

1 paragraph general motivation - framework of urban data science. why everyone would benefit from having this issue solved. cite arcaute on 'recent advances, lobo on 'urban science'. also: alessandretti 2020, louail 2015, barthelemy books (morphogenesis 2018; spatial networks 2022)

2-3 sentences morphometrics (fleischmann, porta, dibble, etc.) diet 2018 on planar map classification. sharifi on urban forms.

1 paragraph problem description - cite cardillo, geisberger, morer (computational costs), maybe venerandi 2016?; vanegas paper on actually *simulating* these spaces

1 paragraph examples - other authors complaining about the issue, without having solved it yet (e.g. best paper ever \citep{vybornova2022automated}); grippa 2018; peponis 2007 merges these into urban blocks (replacing by center lines)

1 paragraph summary of what happens in this paper - 'towards an automated detection of bananas'; 
method inspired by louf and barthelemy;
tried out on X cities across the world, 
from different morphological classes (cite fleischmann);
2 sentences about using OSM as data source, and OSMnx/geopandas/momepy (...) for processing;
code is open source (?) ;
