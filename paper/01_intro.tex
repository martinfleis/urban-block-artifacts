\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

- Importance of street networks for urban analysis
    - talk about availability of data, different use cases from transport to morphology
    to ...
    - try to illustrate the wide applicability so we can then base the claims about the
    importance of the issue on top of it
    - general motivation - framework of urban data science. why everyone would
    benefit from having this issue solved. cite arcaute on 'recent advances, lobo on 'urban
    science'. also: alessandretti 2020, louail 2015, barthelemy books (morphogenesis 2018;
    spatial networks 2022)
- Data need to look different for transport than for morphology ans why it matters
    - Networks vs polygons enclosed by networks (blocks? negative space? we need to pin down the
    terminology we want to use)
- Problem description
    - Each network comes with a different detail and generated "blocks" are not always
    what they seem to be but sometimes are an artifact of transport-focused geometry
    - cite cardillo, geisberger, morer (computational costs), maybe venerandi 2016?;
    vanegas paper on actually *simulating* these spaces
- Examples - other authors complaining about the issue, without having solved
it yet (e.g. best paper ever \cite{vybornova2022automated}); grippa 2018; peponis 2007
merges these into urban blocks (replacing by center lines)
    - include morphometric literature here - mention `momepy.Blocks` algorithm that
    attemps to go around the issue in a specific way (but does not solve it)
        - (fleischmann, porta, dibble, etc.) diet 2018 on planar map
        classification. sharifi on urban forms.
    - description/terminology: cf. hermosilla 2014 'UBRSA'; see strano 2012 for power
    law of "land cells" (spaces surrounded by street segments); most recent: shpuza 2011,
    2017, 2022 (how to get the PDF...). circular compactness - inspired by louf; see also
    more recent barthelemy 2017 with the same figures;
-  summary of what happens in this paper
    - 'towards an automated detection of
    bananas'; method inspired by louf and barthelemy; tried out on 150 cities across the
    world

% 2 sentences about using OSM as data source, and OSMnx/geopandas/momepy (...) for
% processing; code is open source(?) ; - I WOULD KEEP THIS FOR METHODS
